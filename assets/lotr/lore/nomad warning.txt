People of the lands of all Ahâr! The following is urgent business, I beseech you! Beware of those Sand-Usurers!

It has been two moons since I acquired a horse from {choose:Ijdi-ilel/Izêm-ulzuz/Ayûkaph-amâm} for the proud price of a hundred silver coins! And what did I get? An unruly creature, impossible to handle! When I saw the horse I was staggered by its magnificent black and white stripes, and I hoped that with it I could impress my wife when I finally came home. Now I am stuck with this beast which refuses to follow me, making hideous noises all day long!

Stay away from the desert-dwellers; they will deceive you!
